			<p> <font face="Arial" size="4.5px"> Hello, everyone I am Umanga joshi. I am a student of BSc(Hons)Computing on The British college. Beside Computing I am also interested on Bike. Bike design varies greatly to suit a range of different purposes: long-distance travel, commuting, cruising, sport including racing, and off-road riding. In developing countries, bikes are considered utilitarian due to lower prices and greater fuel economy. Of all the bikes in the world, 58% are in the Asia-Pacific and Southern and Eastern Asia regions, excluding car-centric Japan. I also Own a bike, It is a Classic Cruising bike. I Own a Royal Enfield Classic 350. It is of 346cc bike, has Max Power of 19.8 bph @ 5250 rpm, Max Torque of 28Nm @ 4000 rpm, has Fuel Capacity of 13.5 liters and Weightâ€™s up to 187 kg. It has just been 2 years i have brought this bike.It is really comfortable and can reach up to 130km per hour.</p>
