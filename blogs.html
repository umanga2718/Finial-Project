			<p> <font face="Arial" size="4px"> Already 7 mounths have gone and september also on it's way . Thereâ€™s spring in all its glory. But everything is different this year. All around the world, it feels like there is a standstill. We are at a standstill.  We all know why. Covid-19 has brought life a stop. Or, at least, so it feels. Stay inside is what we have to do. A  drastic measure, sure, but it could save lives. So, we comply, like most of the people we know. This new-found solicitude has, of course, repercussions: of all the trips we had planned for 2020 we already had to cancel. We will not be travelling anywhere soon, but When all this is over, we should be ready to see all our destinations. It does not always have to be better, bigger and further. The road ahead might be a well known one, but it is worth exploring.  </p>
